by Christian Guerra and Avi Mehta

# Introduction 
In this project my team and I analyzed a data set containting the power oputages throughput varius states in the United States. The dataset provides comprehensive information on the outages, including details about their causes, durations, and the geographical, climatic, and economic characteristics of the affected areas. Additionally, the dataset includes data on electricity consumption patterns and land-use characteristics, offering a rich context for our analysis.
